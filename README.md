# VaayuNet AQI Analysis and Localised Prediction

[Web APP URL](https://vaayunet.netlify.app/)

VaayuNet is a sophisticated, dual-model web application designed to bridge the critical information gap in air quality monitoring. By leveraging machine learning, it provides both real-time, localized Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis from a simple photograph and long-term AQI trend forecasting.

## The Problem: A Health Information Gap

Official air quality data typically comes from a few expensive, fixed ground stations, leaving massive blind spots on the map. For instance, the entire city of Sonipat (an area of over 2,000 sq km) has just one official monitoring station. This means millions of people in suburban and rural areas have no reliable way of knowing their local air quality.

This isn't just a data gap; it's a **public health threat**. Without localized, real-time information, populations unknowingly endure prolonged exposure to pollutants, significantly increasing the risk of chronic respiratory diseases like COPD, especially in vulnerable groups like children and the elderly.

## Our Solution: VaayuNet

VaayuNet tackles this problem with a two-pronged approach, combining the power of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for immediate analysis and a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for future prediction.

1.  **Real-Time Image Analysis (CNN)**: Users can upload a photo of their immediate surroundings. Our CNN model, trained on the Air Pollution Image Dataset, analyzes the image and instantly classifies it into one of five AQI levels (Good, Moderate, Poor, Unhealthy, Severe).
2.  **Trend Forecasting (RNN)**: Our LSTM-based RNN model analyzes historical time-series data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to identify trends and predict AQI values for the coming months.

This information is presented in a clean, intuitive dashboard, providing users with not just data, but actionable health recommendations.

## Key Features

* **Instant AQI from Image**: Get a real-time AQI assessment by simply uploading a photo of the sky.
* **Weighted AQI Calculation**: We use a more accurate weighted sum formula ($AQI = \sum (C_i \cdot P_i)$) that considers the confidence of all predicted AQI categories, not just the top one.
* **Long-Term Trend Analysis**: View a 24-month trend graph and see future AQI predictions generated by our RNN model.
* **Actionable Health Recommendations**: Receive clear, simple advice based on the current and predicted AQI levels.
* **Modern, Responsive UI**: A clean and intuitive interface built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
* **Client-Side ML**: The CNN model runs directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js for fast, private analysis.

## Future Scope

* **Hybrid Models**: Combine the real-time output of the CNN with the forecasted data from the RNN for more robust and context-aware predictions.
* **Scale to More Locations**: Expand the model's training data to cover multiple cities and countries.
* **Satellite Image Analysis**: Integrate satellite imagery (e.g., from INSAT) and meteorological data to calculate AQI via Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for even broader coverage.
* **Edge Deployment**: Optimize and deploy models on mobile devices for real-time monitoring without needing an internet connection.
